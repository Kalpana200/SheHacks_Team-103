We believe that all  women have potential in them which is waiting to be unlocked.
This site aims to aware the new comers  who don't have much idea about what goes around in technical industries about the myriad of opportunities they can avail. 
It's a one stop destination, for gathering info about latest trends in tech, internship opportunities like outreachy , american express which are just women oriented, various scholarship programmes offered to the YES! US! Women in Tech! 😁, also the Research facilities for us, and finally the most important of all, getting the details of job offerings ♥ .
The Blog section is  cherry🍒 on the top! , which will allow us to motivate many more girls just by sharing our internship and job experience. 
Built by us, for us and for the betterment of us ✌🕊.
